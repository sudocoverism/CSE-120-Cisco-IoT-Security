<h2>Local VPN Server for User's Devices
        
<p1>We are aiming to create a local VPN server for the home network where people can connect their laptops, desktops, and phones. We want to provide protection against malicious Internet-of-Things devices that can foward your device's packet information to an suspicious server without your knowledge.
        

<h2>Specifications of Implementation

We hosting the VPN Server on a Raspberry Pi 4B 2GB. As for the Operating System, we chose the Raspberry PI OS.
